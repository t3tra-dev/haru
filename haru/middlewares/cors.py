"""
This module defines the `CORSMiddleware` class, which provides Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
functionality in the Haru web framework. This middleware adds the necessary CORS headers to HTTP
responses, enabling cross-origin requests from specified origins.

CORS is a mechanism that allows resources on a web server to be requested from another domain outside
the domain from which the resource originated. This middleware can be configured to control which origins,
methods, and headers are allowed for cross-origin requests.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: python

    app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware(
        allow_origins=['https://example.com'],
        allow_methods=['GET', 'POST'],
        allow_headers=['Content-Type'],
    ))

Parameters:
    allow_origins (List[str]): List of origins that are allowed to make requests.
    allow_methods (List[str]): List of HTTP methods allowed (e.g., GET, POST).
    allow_headers (List[str]): List of HTTP headers allowed in requests.
    max_age (Optional[int]): Maximum time in seconds the CORS request is cached.
    allow_credentials (bool): Whether to allow credentials (cookies, authorization headers).

Note:
    This middleware should be applied before any other middlewares that modify the response.
